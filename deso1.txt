Câu 8. Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator is configuring a router as a DHCPv6 server. The administrator issues a show ipv6 dhcp pool command to verify the configuration. Which statement explains the reason that the number of active clients is 0?
img. https://itexamanswers.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/i210895v1n1_210895.jpg
hint. Under the stateless DHCPv6 configuration, indicated by the command ipv6 nd other-config-flag, the DHCPv6 server does not maintain the state information, because client IPv6 addresses are not managed by the DHCP server. Because the clients will configure their IPv6 addresses by combining the prefix/prefix-length and a self-generated interface ID, the ipv6 dhcp pool configuration does not need to specify the valid IPv6 address range. And because clients will use the link-local address of the router interface as the default gateway address, the default gateway address is not necessary.
A. The default gateway address is not provided in the pool.
B. No clients have communicated with the DHCPv6 server yet.
C. The IPv6 DHCP pool configuration has no IPv6 address range specified.
*D. The state is not maintained by the DHCPv6 server under stateless DHCPv6 operation.
Câu 9. Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator configured routers R1 and R2 as part of HSRP group 1. After the routers have been reloaded, a user on Host1 complained of lack of connectivity to the Internet The network administrator issued the show standby brief command on both routers to verify the HSRP operations. In addition, the administrator observed the ARP table on Host1. Which entry should be seen in the ARP table on Host1 in order to gain connectivity to the Internet?
img. https://itexamanswers.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-01-31_201813-768x556-1.png

*A. Nhìn hình học thuộc
Câu 11. Which statement is correct about how a Layer 2 switch determines how to forward frames?
hint. Cut-through frame forwarding reads up to only the first 22 bytes of a frame, which excludes the frame check sequence and thus invalid frames may be forwarded. In addition to broadcast frames, frames with a destination MAC address that is not in the CAM are also flooded out all active ports. Unicast frames are not always forwarded. Received frames with a destination MAC address that is associated with the switch port on which it is received are not forwarded because the destination exists on the network segment connected to that port.
*A. Frame forwarding decisions are based on MAC address and port mappings in the CAM table.
B. Only frames with a broadcast destination address are forwarded out all active switch ports.
C. Unicast frames are always forwarded regardless of the destination MAC address.
D. Cut-through frame forwarding ensures that invalid frames are always dropped.
Câu 12. Which statement describes a result after multiple Cisco LAN switches are interconnected?
hint. In Cisco LAN switches, the microsegmentation makes it possible for each port to represent a separate segment and thus each switch port represents a separate collision domain. This fact will not change when multiple switches are interconnected. However, LAN switches do not filter broadcast frames. A broadcast frame is flooded to all ports. Interconnected switches form one big broadcast domain.
*A. The broadcast domain expands to all switches.
B. One collision domain exists per switch.
C. There is one broadcast domain and one collision domain per switch.
D. Frame collisions increase on the segments connecting the switches.
E. Unicast frames are always forwarded regardless of the destination MAC address.
Câu 13. Match the link state to the interface and protocol status. (Not all options are used.)

Câu 14. Refer to the exhibit. How is a frame sent from PCA forwarded to PCC if the MAC address table on switch SW1 is empty?
img. https://itexamanswers.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-01-31_202702.png
hint. When a switch powers on, the MAC address table is empty. The switch builds the MAC address table by examining the source MAC address of incoming frames. The switch forwards based on the destination MAC address found in the frame header. If a switch has no entries in the MAC address table or if the destination MAC address is not in the switch table, the switch will forward the frame out all ports except the port that brought the frame into the switch.
A. SW1 forwards the frame directly to SW2. SW2 floods the frame to all ports connected to SW2, excluding the port through which the frame entered the switch.
B. SW1 floods the frame on all ports on the switch, excluding the interconnected port to switch SW2 and the port through which the frame entered the switch.
*C. SW1 floods the frame on all ports on SW1, excluding the port through which the frame entered the switch.
D. SW1 drops the frame because it does not know the destination MAC address.
Câu 15. An administrator is trying to remove configurations from a switch. After using the command erase startup-config and reloading the switch, the administrator finds that VLANs 10 and 100 still exist on the switch. Why were these VLANs not removed?
hint. Standard range VLANs (1-1005) are stored in a file that is called vlan.dat that is located in flash memory. Erasing the startup configuration and reloading a switch does not automatically remove these VLANs. The vlan.dat file must be manually deleted from flash memory and then the switch must be reloaded.
*A. Because these VLANs are stored in a file that is called vlan.dat that is located in flash memory, this file must be manually deleted.
B. These VLANs cannot be deleted unless the switch is in VTP client mode.
C. These VLANs are default VLANs that cannot be removed.
D. These VLANs can only be removed from the switch by using the no vlan 10 and no vlan 100 commands.
Câu 16. Match the description to the correct VLAN type. (Not all options are used.)
img. https://itexamanswers.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CCNA-2-v7-final-exam-answers-16.png
hint. A data VLAN is configured to carry user-generated traffic. A default VLAN is the VLAN where all switch ports belong after the initial boot up of a switch loading the default configuration. A native VLAN is assigned to an 802.1Q trunk port, and untagged traffic is placed on it. A management VLAN is any VLAN that is configured to access the management capabilities of a switch. An IP address and subnet mask are assigned to it, allowing the switch to be managed via HTTP, Telnet, SSH, or SNMP.

*C. fa0/10
D. fa0/20
*E. fa0/21
F. fa0/11
Câu 30. How will a router handle static routing differently if Cisco Express Forwarding is disabled?
hint. In most platforms running IOS 12.0 or later, Cisco Express Forwarding is enabled by default. Cisco Express Forwarding eliminates the need for the recursive lookup. If Cisco Express Forwarding is disabled, multiaccess network interfaces require fully specified static routes in order to avoid inconsistencies in their routing tables. Point-to-point interfaces do not have this problem, because multiple end points are not present. With or without Cisco Express Forwarding enabled, using an exit interface when configuring a static route is a viable option.
A. It will not perform recursive lookups.
*B. Ethernet multiaccess interfaces will require fully specified static routes to avoid routing inconsistencies.

D. Serial point-to-point interfaces will require fully specified static routes to avoid routing inconsistencies.
Câu 31. Compared with dynamic routes, what are two advantages of using static routes on a router? (Choose two.)
hint. Static routes are manually configured on a router. Static routes are not automatically updated and must be manually reconfigured if the network topology changes. Thus static routing improves network security because it does not make route updates among neighboring routers. Static routes also improve resource efficiency by using less bandwidth, and no CPU cycles are used to calculate and communicate routes.
*A. They improve network security.
B. They take less time to converge when the network topology changes.
C. They improve the efficiency of discovering neighboring networks.
*D. They use fewer router resources.
Câu 32. Refer to the exhibit. Which route was configured as a static route to a specific network using the next-hop address?
img. https://itexamanswers.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/rx6.png
hint. The C in a routing table indicates an interface that is up and has an IP address assigned. The S in a routing table signifies that a route was installed using the ip route command. Two of the routing table entries shown are static routes to a specific destination (the 192.168.2.0 network). The entry that has the S denoting a static route and [1/0] was configured using the next-hop address. The other entry (S 192.168.2.0/24 is directly connected, Serial 0/0/0) is a static route configured using the exit interface. The entry with the 0.0.0.0 route is a default static route which is used to send packets to any destination network that is not specifically listed in the routing table.
*A. S 10.17.2.0/24 [1/0] via 10.16.2.2
B. S 0.0.0.0/0 [1/0] via 10.16.2.2

B. 2001::/3
C. FC00::/7
*D. FE80::/10
Câu 35. Which two statements are characteristics of routed ports on a method switch? (Choose two.)
hint. Routed ports are physical ports that act similarly to a router interface. They are not associated with a particular VLAN, they do not support subinterfaces, and they are used for point-to-point links. In a switched network, they are mostly configured between switches at the core and distribution layers. To configure routed ports, the no switchport interface command has to be used on the appropriate ports.

There are several recommended STP stability mechanisms to help mitigate STP manipulation attacks: PortFast – used to immediately bring an interface configured as an access or trunk port to the forwarding state from a blocking state. Applied to all end-user ports. BPDU guard – immediately error-disables a port that receives a BPDU. Applied to all end-user ports. The receipt of BPDUs may be part of an unauthorized attempt to add a switch to the network. Root guard – prevents a switch from becoming the root switch. Applied to all ports where the root switch should not be located. Loop guard – detects unidirectional links to prevent alternate or root ports from becoming designated ports. Applied to all ports that are or can become nondesignated.

Câu 52. Why is DHCP snooping required when using the Dynamic ARP Inspection feature?
hint. DAI relies on DHCP snooping. DHCP snooping listens to DHCP message exchanges and builds a bindings database of valid tuples (MAC address, IP address, VLAN interface). When DAI is enabled, the switch drops ARP packet if the sender MAC address and sender IP address do not match an entry in the DHCP snooping bindings database. However, it can be overcome through static mappings. Static mappings are useful when hosts configure static IP addresses, DHCP snooping cannot be run, or other switches in the network do not run dynamic ARP inspection. A static mapping associates an IP address to a MAC address on a VLAN.
A. It relies on the settings of trusted and untrusted ports set by DHCP snooping.
B. It uses the MAC address table to verify the default gateway IP address.
C. It redirects ARP requests to the DHCP server for verification.
*D. It uses the MAC-address-to-IP-address binding database to validate an ARP packet.

Câu 92. After a host has generated an IPv6 address by using the DHCPv6 or SLAAC process, how does the host verify that the address is unique and therefore usable?
hint. Before a host can actually configure and use an IPv6 address learned through SLAAC or DHCP, the host must verify that no other host is already using that address. To verify that the address is indeed unique, the host sends an ICMPv6 neighbor solicitation to the address. If no neighbor advertisement is returned, the host considers the address to be unique and configures it on the interface.
A. The host sends an ICMPv6 echo request message to the DHCPv6 or SLAAC-learned address and if no reply is returned, the address is considered unique.
*B. The host sends an ICMPv6 neighbor solicitation message to the DHCP or SLAAC-learned address and if no neighbor advertisement is returned, the address is considered unique.
C. The host checks the local neighbor cache for the learned address and if the address is not cached, it it considered unique.

Câu 167. What defines a host route on a Cisco router?
hint. A host route is an IPv4 address with a 32-bit mask, or an IPv6 address with a 128-bit mask. When an active interface on a router is configured with an IPv4 or IPv6 address, a local host route is automatically added to the routing table. A host route is marked with L in the output of the routing table. For IPv6 static routes, the next-hop address can be the link-local address of the adjacent router. In this case you must specify the interface type and the interface number of the local router.
A. The link-local address is added automatically to the routing table as an IPv6 host route.
*B. An IPv4 static host route configuration uses a destination IP address of a specific device and a /32 subnet mask.
C. A host route is designated with a C in the routing table.
D. A static IPv6 host route must include the interface type and the interface number of the next hop router.
Câu 168. What else is required when configuring an IPv6 static route using a next-hop link-local address?

Câu 172. While attending a conference, participants are using laptops for network connectivity. When a guest speaker attempts to connect to the network, the laptop fails to display any available wireless networks. The access point must be operating in which mode?
hint. Active is a mode used to configure an access point so that clients must know the SSID to connect to the access point. APs and wireless routers can operate in a mixed mode meaning that that multiple wireless standards are supported. Open is an authentication mode for an access point that has no impact on the listing of available wireless networks for a client. When an access point is configured in passive mode, the SSID is broadcast so that the name of wireless network will appear in the listing of available networks for clients.
A. mixed
B. passive
*C. active
D. open
